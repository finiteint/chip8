# Cassowary - A Dodgy & Shoddy CHIP-8 Emulator

The worst CHIP-8 emulator ever. Totally pointless
and useless.

This was done as an exercise while working through
Tim McNamara's "Rust in Action" book.

Display dumps ASCII art to console on refresh--totally useless.

Sound prints `BEEP.start` and `BEEP.end` (also tries
to play a sine wave, but that part doesn't always work).

Keyboard instructions do not work at all.
